# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

  - I feel mostly good about using for loops moving forward.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0,
  and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or
  learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel?
  Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

  - It feels good to learn new things. I felt some struggle and it was definitely productive.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
  Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

  - I feel good about what I need to learn. I will just be sure to keep practicing so the material is fresh for Mod 1.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

  - I don't have additional questions right now, but I'll be sure to use W3 schools and other resources moving forward.
